# The DS Download Play child: the game, for a console that has no card.
#
# An ordinary architectds ROM, built from this folder so that its build tree
# (child/build/...) is apart from the parent's. It is the parent's own code --
# the engine (engine -> ../source) and the game (game -> ../dll/hl) -- built
# once more with HLDS_CHILD:
#
#  - the game is linked into the program rather than loaded from NitroFS as
#    dsl/hl.dsl: Download Play sends the header and the two processors'
#    programs, never a file system;
#  - no card is looked for; the game's data is what it is sent, served from
#    memory by the "air:" drive (source/net/AirDevice.hpp);
#  - a Nintendo DS program only (unit code 0): sent over the air it runs in
#    DS mode, even on a DSi.
#
# No game content is in it. The host sends that after it has started, out of
# its own card (tools/hlds-convert's air/ archives). For a test with no host,
# HLDS_CHILD_TESTPACK=<map> builds one map's in (tools/child_testpack.py):
# that build is for an emulator on this PC, never to be given to anyone.
#
# Usage: ./make.sh builds it after the parent; or, from this folder with the
# project's venv active, python build.py.
