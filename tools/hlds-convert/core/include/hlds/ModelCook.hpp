// From a studio model to what the DS draws: mdl/<name>.hmd (shared/HlModel.hpp)
// and its skin, one texture.
//
// Three things are worked out here so that the DS does not have to:
//
//   THE SKIN AS COMMAND STREAMS. The model's strips and fans become triangle
//   strips and triangles of geometry-engine commands, cut into batches that
//   each use few enough bones to fit the hardware's matrix stack, with a
//   "use this bone's matrix" command wherever the bone changes.
//
//   ONE TEXTURE. A model comes with twenty or thirty little textures of any
//   size; the DS wants few, and powers of two. They are packed into one atlas
//   and the triangles' coordinates moved to match.
//
//   ANIMATION AS KEYS. Each sequence the map uses becomes, per bone, a short
//   list of keys: a bone that does not move in the sequence gets one, a bone
//   that moves slowly gets one every several frames, and the step is the
//   largest that reproduces every original frame to within a degree and a
//   quarter of a unit.
