// Texture pixels between the game's format and the encoder's.
//
// A GoldSrc texture is 8-bit indices and a 256-colour palette, any size that is
// a multiple of 16. The DS wants a power of two, usually a smaller one, so
// every texture goes through true colour and a resample on its way.
//
// COLOUR KEY. A texture whose name starts with '{' (grates, ladders, fences)
// has holes: palette index 255 is not a colour but "nothing here". That
// becomes alpha, and stays a hard edge through the resample -- a texel is
// either there or not, as it will be on the DS.
