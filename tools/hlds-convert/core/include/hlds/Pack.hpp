// From the converter's own files to what goes on the card.
//
// Cooking writes loose files -- levels, textures, models, sounds -- into a
// stage folder on the PC, where a texture or a sound shared by fifty maps is
// made once and found again by the next run. The console is given something
// else: one archive per map, holding all that the map loads in the order it
// loads it (NpacWriter.hpp), and one more for what belongs to no map. On a
// card, opening a file is the slow part; a map used to be two hundred of
// them.
//
// What a map needs is read out of its level, with the very functions the
// console names its files by, so the two cannot disagree about a name.
