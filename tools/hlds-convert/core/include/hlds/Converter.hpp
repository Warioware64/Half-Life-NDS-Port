// The conversion as a whole: a game folder in, a card's worth of files out.
//
// This is the layer the command line and the GUI both drive. It owns the
// decisions that are about a RUN rather than about one file -- where things go
// on the card, which maps exist, what the manifest says afterwards -- and
// reports through plain callbacks, so that it knows nothing about a terminal
// or a window.
