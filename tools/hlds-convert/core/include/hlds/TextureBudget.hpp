// How big each of a map's textures may be, so that all of them fit.
//
// Two things on the DS are finite and shared by every texture of a map:
//
//  * TEXELS. 4x4 compressed data goes in a bank pair that holds 524,288
//    texels. World textures are kept to one pair so the other is free for
//    models and weapons.
//  * PALETTE. A compressed texture's palette offset is 14 bits counting pairs
//    of colours: 32,768 colours for everything, which is also what the 64 KB
//    palette bank holds.
//
// Every texture starts at its default size (TextureSize.hpp). If the map is
// over on texels, the texture that is doing the LEAST with its memory -- the
// fewest square units of wall per texel -- is halved along its longer side,
// and that repeats until the map fits. A texture covering one small sign gives
// way before one covering every corridor.
//
// The palette is then shared out by size: more texels, more colours, scaled
// back for the whole map if the total would not fit.
//
// A3I5 textures (the '{' textures of brushes drawn with holes) have a budget
// of their own, 8 bits a texel: the upper half of bank B.
// That half is the only texture memory 4x4 data cannot use, so it costs the
// opaque textures nothing; go past it and every byte comes out of theirs.
