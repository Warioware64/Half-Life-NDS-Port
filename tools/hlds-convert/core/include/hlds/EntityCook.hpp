// The map's entities that DO something, turned into logic records.
//
// On the PC an entity is a bag of text keys that the game parses when the map
// loads and keeps consulting as it runs. On the DS none of that happens: this
// reads the keys once, here, and writes down what they amount to -- a door's
// travel as a vector, a wait as milliseconds, a name as a number -- so that
// the console only ever sees fixed records (LogicRecord, shared/HlLevel.hpp)
// and the code that runs them (shared/HlLogic.hpp) never touches a string.
//
// Classes this does not know are COUNTED, not refused. A map with monsters and
// sound entities still cooks; the count is how far the port has to go.
