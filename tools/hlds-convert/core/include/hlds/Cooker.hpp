// A parsed .bsp to a cooked level.
//
// This is where a GoldSrc map stops being GoldSrc's and becomes the DS's:
// floats become fixed point, faces become geometry-engine command runs with
// their light baked in, and everything the console will not use is left behind
// -- tool faces, the third clip hull, planes nothing references.
//
// What it keeps is the map's own structure: the same BSP tree, the same leaves,
// the same visibility rows. The DS finds the camera's leaf and reads the PVS
// exactly as the PC engine does; it just has much less to do afterwards.
