// The tram: a train on a track of path_tracks (shared/HlLogic.hpp), on a
// synthetic track and then on the real thing.
//
// The synthetic track checks the rules one at a time: a train that waits to be
// started, a node that sets its speed, a node that fires something as it is
// passed, the end of the track and what is fired there, and which way the
// train faces.
//
// A second synthetic track is driven, as the player drives a train (USE at
// its controls, forward and back a quarter of its speed at a press): through
// stopped to backwards, back past a node that fires again, to the start of
// the track; let go of by a step aside, a jump, or USE again. With the game,
// c2a2's train is driven, and into c2a2a at its controls still; c2a3's crash
// train is driven from its func_traincontrols only.
//
// With HLDS_VALVE_DIR set, the opening tram ride is run from end to end with
// nobody at the controls -- six maps, five level changes, two platforms that
// lower the tram from one track to another -- and has to finish with the tram
// at rest at the station and the player still inside it. Nothing draws; a
// minute of the ride takes a fraction of a second.
