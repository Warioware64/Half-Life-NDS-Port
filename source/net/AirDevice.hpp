// The "air:" drive, read-only, for a console that was sent the game and has
// no card (the Download Play child, HLDS_CHILD). The game opens its files on
// it as it opens the card's (Global's paths are "air:/..." there), and a
// file is one of two things:
//
//  - a member of the guest stream being received (HlGuest.hpp): the map's.
//    Opened, it is the next member to come, by its name, and a read undoes
//    the stream's next bytes straight into the reader's own buffer -- the
//    level's block, a model's, a sound's. Nothing of the stream is kept: a
//    member is read once, in the order the stream has them, which is the
//    order the game loads them in. One asked for out of turn is not there;
//    those of a kind no longer asked for are passed over.
//  - a file put here whole (put()): what was received at the start, which
//    the game reads in its own order (the letters, the display's pictures),
//    let go of once it has (dropOwned()); and a test's debug_start.txt.
