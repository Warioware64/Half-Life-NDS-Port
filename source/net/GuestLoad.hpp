// What a console that was sent the game (HLDS_CHILD) is sent, taken as it
// comes (HlGuest.hpp's streams):
//
//  - the common stream, at the start: its files put on the "air:" drive whole
//    for the game to read in its own order as it starts up (the letters, the
//    display's pictures, the menu's sounds), and let go of once it has
//    (dropCommon);
//  - a group's base: each model's block and sound's clip kept as it came,
//    by its name, from one map to the next; the map's loaders borrow them
//    (borrow) rather than read them;
//  - a map's own stream: given to the "air:" drive (beginMap), whose files
//    the map's loaders read as they come, each straight into its own block.
//
// Where the bytes come from is a GuestSupply: the air -- the host's frames,
// HlNetAir.hpp, taken as they come while the stream is read -- or, for a
// test with no host, what the build was given (MemorySupply, in pieces the
// size of what the air brings).
