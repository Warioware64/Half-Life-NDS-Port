// What keeps watch for memory going wrong, and what says so when it has.
//
// * The heap: every block the program asks for (malloc and the rest, the
//   game library's too: GameDll's resolver) has a header -- its size, who
//   asked for it -- and four bytes after its end that must stay as they
//   were. A block given back is checked; small ones are kept back a while,
//   filled with a pattern that must still be there when they really go. So
//   a write past a block's end, or into one given back, is caught with the
//   block's size and the address of the code that asked for it, instead of
//   breaking the allocator's own lists to be found much later (a crash in
//   free(), far from the culprit: 2026-10-28).
// * The stack: the lowest words of its room (DTCM) hold a pattern, looked
//   at every frame.
// * The game library's code (hl.dsl): summed when it is loaded, and summed
//   again at each map load and save, and on the crash screen.
// * The crash screen (in place of libnds's): the build's name
//   (tools/buildid.py; its ELFs are under build/elf/<name>/), where the
//   fault was -- the program, the library and how far into it, or ITCM --
//   the registers, the code addresses found on the stack, and the three
//   checks above.
