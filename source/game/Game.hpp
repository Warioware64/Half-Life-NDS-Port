// The running map: everything about it that changes.
//
// The level file is read-only tables. This holds the other half -- where each
// brush entity is right now, what each logic record is doing, the collision's
// picture of both -- and advances it, once per displayed frame:
//
//   1. the entity logic (shared/HlLogic.hpp): timers, doors and lifts moving,
//      triggers the player has walked into. Moving brushes carry and push the
//      player here.
//   2. USE, if the player pressed it.
//   3. the player's own movement, against the world as the logic left it.
//
// The order matters: a lift moves and takes the player with it BEFORE the
// player's move looks for the ground, or they would fall through it for a
// frame every frame.
//
// One arrays-and-a-loop design on purpose (see HlLogic.hpp). `game` is it.
