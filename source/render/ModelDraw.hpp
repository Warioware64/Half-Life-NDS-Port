// Drawing the map's actors: models posed on the CPU and skinned by the
// hardware.
//
// Every vertex of a Half-Life model belongs to one bone, and a model's cooked
// stream is "use the matrix in slot N" followed by the vertices of that bone.
// So drawing an actor is: work out, for each bone, the one matrix that takes
// a vertex in that bone's space all the way to view space; put those in the
// matrix stack's slots; send the stream.
//
// That matrix is built here in 64-bit arithmetic -- pose, then the actor's
// place and facing, then the camera -- rather than by asking the hardware to
// multiply three together, because the last of them has small numbers in it
// (a model's vertex is in 128ths of a unit, the view's unit is 128 units) and
// the hardware's 12 fractional bits would not leave enough of them.
//
// Not in ITCM: this is a few actors a frame, not thousands of surfaces.
