// PROFILE's picture of the player on the top screen: the model the others
// see in a match, turning slowly where the title's picture is, in the
// colours the profile has (HlRemap.hpp's, as the match lays them over it).
//
// Its model and its skin in 256 colours are the common archive's
// (HlUi.hpp: kProfileModelFile, kProfileSkinFile), there where the card has
// a multiplayer map. They are read when PROFILE opens and let go when it
// closes: nothing of it stays beside a map. Drawn by HudDraw with the
// title's picture (menuFrame), after it.
