// Drawing the world: which surfaces can be seen from here, and sending them.
//
// The cooked level already holds each surface as a finished run of
// geometry-engine commands, so "drawing" is choosing. Each frame:
//
//  1. Find the leaf the eye is in. If it changed, decode that leaf's PVS row
//     and stamp every visible leaf and the nodes above it.
//  2. Walk the BSP tree front to back, skipping branches with no stamp and
//     boxes outside the view. In each leaf reached, take the surfaces that face
//     the eye and are inside the view, until the frame's budget is spent.
//  3. Send the chosen surfaces in index order -- they are stored sorted by
//     texture -- by copying their words to the geometry FIFO.
//
// THE BUDGET is the whole reason for the order of step 2. The hardware stops
// at 2048 polygons and 6144 vertices and simply drops the rest, in whatever
// order they were sent. Walking front to back and stopping at a budget of our
// own means that what gets left out is the farthest geometry, which the fog
// is already hiding, rather than whichever wall happened to come last.
//
// BRUSH ENTITIES -- doors, grates, glass -- are drawn after the world, each
// under its own translation, when one of the leaves it touches is visible and
// its box is in view. Opaque ones go straight out. The rest wait: the hardware
// draws every see-through polygon after every opaque one, in the order they
// were SENT and without sorting them, so they are sent far to near. That
// includes the cutout class, which looks opaque: a polygon with an A3I5
// texture is treated as see-through whatever its own alpha (measured, not
// assumed -- NEA's own header says otherwise).
//
// The walk and the send are in WorldDraw.itcm.arm.cpp: ARM code in ITCM.
