// The head-up display, over the 3D picture as the game has it: health and
// armour at the bottom left, what is in the gun and what is carried for it
// at the bottom right, a crosshair in the middle. And the picture shown
// while a map loads.
//
// Both are the game's own pictures, cooked to the card (shared/HlUi.hpp); a
// card without them has neither. The display is not 3D at all: it is put on
// sprites of the top screen (the main engine's, in video bank F, after
// TopText's in G), added to the picture as the game adds its display -- so
// it costs the 3D engine nothing, and is always in front. A pane redrawn when
// what it shows changes: the bottom row (health, armour, ammunition), the
// lamp, the crosshair; and the red of being hurt, a sheet of sprites over all
// of it, as bright as the hurt is. The loading picture is still a quad.
//
// A card that has the game's 640 set (HlUi.hpp, kHud640File) has it drawn as
// the game draws it at 640 by 480 (HlHudLayout.hpp): its sizes, its places,
// its marks of where a hurt came from and its pictures of the kinds of hurt.
// One cooked before that has the 320 set, in the places this first had.
