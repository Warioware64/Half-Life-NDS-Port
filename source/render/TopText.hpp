// What the game writes over the picture: a chapter's name, the names of the
// introduction, the game's own title (the level's Messages: HlLevel.hpp).
//
// It is not drawn in 3D. The letters are put, by the processor, on sprites of
// the top screen, in front of the 3D picture: video bank G -- which nothing
// else uses -- is a sheet of 256 by 128 pixels in sixteen colours, the same
// form as the touch screen's canvas (shared/HlFont.hpp), shown as four bands
// of 256 by 32 that are each put where a line of writing goes. So it costs
// no texture memory and is the same in every way of drawing the world; and
// since the sprites are added to what is behind them, as the game adds its
// writing, a fade is nothing but their colours.
//
// Two messages at once at most (a title and a name, say), two lines each.
