// The card of a multiplayer map on the title's top screen, in the lobby and
// while looking for a game: its picture (HlPreview.hpp: taken the first time
// this console hosted a match on it), and beside it its name, how many it is
// for, whether a console without the game can be sent it.
//
// Two textures, made when the card is shown and let go when it is not: the
// picture in the console's own colours, and the words, drawn with the touch
// screen's fonts into a canvas off the screen and made a texture of the UI's
// colours. Drawn by HudDraw with the title's picture (menuFrame), over it.
