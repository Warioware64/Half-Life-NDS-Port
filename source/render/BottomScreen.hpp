// The touch screen while the game is played: a bar along the top (MENU,
// USE, RELOAD), the framed aim pad with JUMP, the lamp and DUCK in a column
// beside it, and a slot for each weapon along the bottom, with the game's
// own picture of it; the messages of the moments the game is busy; and --
// when it is asked for -- the debug readout over the top. Drawn on the touch
// canvas (ui/TouchCanvas.hpp) in the suit's amber and the game's own fonts.
//
// Where everything is, is shared/HlTouchLayout.hpp's table, used here to
// draw and by Input to test a touch, so the two cannot disagree. (The pause
// menu has the whole screen to itself: ui/Menu.hpp.)
