// Streaming a map's textures.
//
// A map cooked with --stream-textures has textures that are bigger than
// video memory can hold all at once, marked kTextureStreamed. TextureCache
// draws those as a flat color; this reads the real ones in from the card as
// they come into view and lets the ones that have not been seen for a while go.
//
// A texture drawn in the last few frames is wanted above all else, one drawn
// a little while ago not as much.
// What a map has room for is found when it is loaded (begin):
// When a map is loaded, it gets what is left over after after NEA handles
// the not-streamed textures, sprites and models.
// The textures used by every view (TextureRef::share) are loaded as resident,
// the rest by how widely they are wanted. Maps whose textures all fit have all
// of them resident and never stream at all.
//
// The textures go into a fixed region of video memory taken from NEA when the
// map is loaded (NEA_TextureRegionReserve4x4 and NEA_PaletteRegionReserve):
// the plan's places are the places in it, so what the plan says fits does fit.
// What is read is written by VramWriter, a piece at a time in the vertical
// blanks, and drawn once it is all there. The top of the region is the
// weapons' skin slots (ModelCache).
