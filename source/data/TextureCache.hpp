// The loaded level's textures, as NEA materials.
//
// One material per entry of the level's texture table, in the same order, so
// the renderer goes from a surface's texture index to something it can bind
// with one array read. Each comes from its own .htx file on the card
// (shared/HlTexture.hpp), already in one of the hardware's own formats -- 4x4
// compressed, or A3I5 for textures with holes -- so the file's pieces are
// handed to NEA as they are.
//
// A texture that is missing or unreadable is not an error. Its material stays
// null and the renderer draws those surfaces in their baked light alone --
// a grey wall is a better thing to show a player than a refusal to start.
//
// Streamed textures are not loaded here. They are drawn as a flat colour until
// TextureStream has read the real one in, and again after it has made way for another.
// Either way what a surface binds is two words (bind()), which is why the surfaces
// that name them can all be drawn alike.
