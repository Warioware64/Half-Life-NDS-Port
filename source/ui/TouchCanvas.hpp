// The touch screen as something to draw on: one layer of the sub engine,
// 256 by 192 pixels in sixteen colours, every cell with a tile of its own
// (shared/HlFont.hpp draws on it); and the fonts it is written in.
//
// Video memory: bank H (32 KB, sub background) and nothing else, so that the
// four big banks stay free for 3D textures and capture.
//
//   0 ..  2 KB   the layer's map: cell (x, y) shows tile 64 + y * 32 + x
//   2 .. 26 KB   those 768 tiles
//
// The fonts are the game's own, cooked to the card (ui/font*.hfn). On a card
// that has not got them everything is written in the 8x8 letters that are in
// the ROM anyway, by the same code.
