// The DSi's DSP, as the game uses it: the echo of the room, the room
// effects' Enhanced (the program is teak/, assembly; its model
// shared/dsp/hl_dsp.h).
//
// Nothing here exists on a DS, or on a DSi running the game without DSi
// rights: start() says no, and everything else does nothing. Sound then plays
// as it does on a DS.
//
// The DSP cannot hear the sixteen ordinary channels. What echoes is a copy
// of their mix the ARM7's sound program sends (its pipeline captures it:
// Arm7Audio::send); each frame the new part of it is passed on to the DSP --
// through the port, never its own bus (tools/hwtest/dsp_bus) -- which puts
// out the echo alone. (The music is the ARM7's, not the DSP's.)
