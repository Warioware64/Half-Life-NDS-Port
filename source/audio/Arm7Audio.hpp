// The ARM9's side of the game's own sound on the ARM7 (arm7/source/Audio.cpp):
// what Sound asks -- a sound played, changed, stopped; the music's ring --
// put into the shared block (shared/HlAudioLink.hpp), and what the ARM7 says
// back -- which sounds have ended -- taken out of it once a frame.
//
// A sound is known by a token: 0 is none. The ARM7
// has fourteen channels for sounds; play() gives 0 when all of them are
// taken (the caller lets something go and asks again), counting a sound as
// taken from when it is asked for until its end is seen.
