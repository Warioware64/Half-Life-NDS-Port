// What is heard: the map's sounds in memory, played by the game's own sound
// program on the ARM7 (arm7/source/Audio.cpp, by way of Arm7Audio), in layers.
//
// A layer (HlSound.hpp) is a kind of sound: the player's own, the world's,
// the voice, the loops of a place, the menu. Each has its share of the
// thirteen voices and gives way in its turn (HlMixer.hpp has the rules), and
// each has a volume the player sets. The music is beside them: stereo, a
// ring the ARM7 plays round, read off the card as it plays. The room the
// player is in is the ARM7's (or, Enhanced, the DSi's DSP's: DspAudio).
//
// The clips are the map's cooked sounds where they already are in memory:
// the ARM7 is told where each is, and the hardware plays the ADPCM itself,
// loops and all. A sound is known by a token (a "handle").
//
// The game's shared code says what was heard and where (a SoundQueue); this
// turns each into a volume and a side by where the camera is, plays it, and
// goes on placing it as the camera moves. A map's sounds are read into
// memory when it loads, except the words of its spoken lines: those are
// long, said once, and read off the card as they are spoken.
//
// Sound data is played by the ARM7 straight out of main memory, so nothing
// here may be freed while a voice is still on it: unload() silences
// everything first.
