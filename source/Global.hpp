// Global process/init singleton. Brings up the console hardware (IRQs, DSi
// clock, FAT, Nitro Engine Advanced) and exposes the on-SD data paths the rest
// of the runtime builds on. Same shape as the Riven port's Global.
//
// SCREENS: the 3D world is on the TOP screen and the touch screen is the aim
// pad, the way DS first-person shooters do it.
//
// TWO STEPS. Init() brings up everything that does not depend on the map;
// InitVideo() brings up the 3D engine.
//
// The hardware draws 2048 polygons and 6144 vertices a frame and no more, and
// every map is drawn in ONE pass, at 60 frames a second: what a view asks for
// beyond that is left out from the far end and hidden in fog (WorldDraw).
// Video banks A, B and C are textures; D is kept back for FrameFreeze, which
// captures the last picture of a map into it while the next one loads.
