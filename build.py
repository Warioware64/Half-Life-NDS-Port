# No game content is built into the ROM. Every map, texture and sound is made
# by tools/hlds-convert from the player's own copy of Half-Life and read from
# the SD card under _nds/hl_nds/data/ at runtime.
#
# THE GAME is a dynamic library apart, as hl.dll is on the PC: the monsters,
# the weapons, the logic, the saves' map state (dll/hl/, and the shared
# headers it instantiates). It is built against the ELF below and carried in
# the ROM's NitroFS as dsl/hl.dsl; the engine loads it at startup and the two
# speak through the tables in source/game/GameApi.hpp. HL_DSL is defined in
# its build: there the engine's objects and hot code are reached through the
# engine's table.
#
# HOT CODE: a source named Foo.arm.cpp is built as ARM instead of Thumb
# (architectds), and one named Foo.itcm.arm.cpp is ALSO placed in the 32 KB
# ITCM by the BlocksDS linker script, which matches objects on `*.itcm*`. The
# order of the two suffixes matters: architectds tests for the `.arm.cpp`
# ending, so Foo.arm.itcm.cpp would be ITCM but Thumb. A single function is
# marked in the source instead: HL_ARM, HL_ITCM (source/Hot.hpp) and, for the
# code the host shares, HL_HOT (shared/HlFixed.hpp).
#
# HLDS_JOBS=4 in the environment keeps ninja to four compilers at once.
