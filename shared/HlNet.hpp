// A game between consoles, over the DS's local wireless: what goes through
// the air and how each end keeps its account of it.
//
// THE RADIO has one console the host and up to three its clients. Every
// frame the host sends one frame that all the clients hear (its CMD), and
// each client answers with one of its own (its REPLY), which only the host
// hears. Nothing else is used while a game is played: that pair is the one
// thing the hardware does on time, and it does it every frame.
//
// WHAT IS SAID. Each console runs its own player and says, every frame,
// where that player is and what they are doing: a STATE, sixteen bytes,
// whole each time -- one lost is replaced by the next. What cannot be lost
// (a shot that hit, a death, a pickup taken, a door set off) is an EVENT:
// numbered, sent again in every frame until the other end says it has it,
// and taken in order, once.
//
// A client's events go to the host; what the others need of them the host
// passes on in its own. So the host's events are one numbered stream that
// every client follows, each from the number it was given when it joined,
// and the host sends from the oldest that any of them still lacks.
//
// FILES. A console started by Download Play has no card: it asks the host
// for each file it opens, and the host sends it in pieces (FileSender,
// FileReceiver, at the bottom). That is done before a match, in frames of
// its own kind.
//
// std-only, no heap, fixed buffers: the console runs part of this in an
// interrupt, and the host tests run all of it (test_net) through a link
// that loses frames.
