#pragma once

// What the two processors say to each other about sound (the ARM7's own
// audio core, arm7/source; the ARM9's client, source/audio). One block in
// main RAM, which the ARM9 reaches through its uncached mirror and the ARM7
// as it is (it has no cache):
//
//  * COMMANDS, ARM9 to ARM7: a ring of fixed-size records, written by the
//    ARM9 and taken by the ARM7 at the start of each of its blocks (64
//    samples, 2 ms). No interrupts, nothing on the FIFO that the wifi and
//    the card also use; a full ring refuses (the caller tries again next
//    frame or does without).
//  * STATUS, ARM7 to ARM9: a ring of ENDS -- each sound that finished on its
//    own or was stopped, by its voice and the caller's token, so that the
//    ARM9 knows to the block when a voice is free and a word is spoken --
//    and the core's counters (its load, blocks late, music run dry).
//
// Which voice plays what is the ARM9's choice (HlMixer.hpp's rules); the
// ARM7 plays each sound on a free channel and says, by the caller's token,
// when it ended. (A sound being faded out keeps its token after its voice
// has gone to another, as a maxmod handle did.)
//
// Every field one side writes, the other only reads; indices only grow
// (wrapping at 2^32), so either side sees how far the other has got.
// std-only: the host tests run both sides.
