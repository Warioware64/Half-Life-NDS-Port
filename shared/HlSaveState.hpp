// The whole state of the map the player is in, for a save: every door,
// trigger and train as it is, every actor where it stands and what it is
// doing, what is in flight, the marks on the walls, the player themselves.
//
// It is laid over a map that has just been started afresh: the map's own
// data (what the level file holds) is never in a save, only what has
// changed since it began. So a save is of one cooked map exactly -- its
// checksum and its counts are in the state's heading, and laid over any
// other it is refused.
//
// Written with yas, a field at a time, and not as the structures lie in
// memory: a pointer is never written (a field is, only by its type), the
// file is the same from the PC's tests and from the console, and there is
// no padding in it. What that way of writing would otherwise risk -- a
// field added to the game and forgotten here -- cannot happen: the fields
// are not listed here at all, each structure is taken apart whole
// (HlFields.hpp), and one whose count of fields has changed does not build.
//
// yas says a bad archive by throwing, and the console is built without
// exceptions: so nothing is read that has not first been shown to be this
// build's own writing -- the heading's fingerprint of every structure's
// layout, the map's checksum and counts, and the exact length all that
// implies. (And the save it lies in is checksummed whole: HlSave.hpp.)
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it (test_savestate).
