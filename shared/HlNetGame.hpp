#pragma once

// A match between consoles: HlNet.hpp's frames and events, joined to the
// game.
//
// Each console runs the whole game for its own player, as it does alone, and
// this is what it adds each frame (netTick, after the game's own tick):
//
//   - says where its player is (the state in the next frame);
//   - turns what its player did to the others into events: a shot fired, a
//     hit on another player (a CLAIM: the shooter's console found it, with
//     the other's own hit boxes, and the victim's console takes it), a
//     grenade gone off, something of the map used or struck, a pickup
//     wanted, its own death;
//   - takes the others' events: is hurt by their claims, hears their shots,
//     sees their grenades burst, uses and strikes the map as they did;
//   - puts the others where they say they are: each an actor of the kind
//     Player, with the players' model, gliding between what is heard;
//   - has each of them walk into the map's triggers, doors and lifts here
//     too (logicGhostTouch), so that the same things move on every console.
//
// The host, besides, says who has a pickup when it is wanted, brings it
// back after its time, keeps the scores, and ends the match.
//
// std-only: the host tests play matches with it (test_net).
