// What a console with no card is sent (the Download Play child): a GUEST
// STREAM, made by the converter (air/ on the host's card) and read as it
// arrives. Each member goes straight to where it is to stay -- the level's
// block, a model's, a sound clip, video memory -- and nothing of the stream
// is kept: there is no archive in a guest's memory.
//
// Three kinds of stream:
//  - the common one, once, at the start: the letters, the display's pictures,
//    the menu's sounds;
//  - a group's base (the maps of a game between consoles, the Hazard Course,
//    Uplink), once: the models and sounds every map of the group has, which
//    stay from one map to the next;
//  - a map's own: its level, its textures and sprites, the skins of all its
//    models (video memory is laid out again with every map), and the models
//    and sounds the base has not.
//
// A stream is a header, then its members in the order the console loads
// them: the level, textures, sprites, models, skins, sounds. A member is a
// record and its bytes: LZ77 (HlLz77Stream.hpp) or as they are.
