#pragma once

// The game's sprites -- glows, flashes, explosions, the pictures beams are
// made of -- as the DS draws them.
//
// A sprite is cooked to ONE texture: its frames side by side in rows (an
// atlas), each shrunk to a few dozen texels, in the A3I5 format: 32 colours
// and 8 levels of see-through. The level's Sprites section (SpriteRef) says
// how the atlas is cut up and how big the sprite is in the world.
//
// MOST OF THE GAME'S SPRITES ARE "ADDITIVE": drawn by adding their colour to
// what is behind, so that black is nothing and white is a glare. The DS
// cannot add. They are cooked so that how bright a texel was becomes how
// solid it is, and its colour is made as bright as it will go: a glow is then
// a patch of its own colour, see-through at its edges. Against something
// dark -- nearly everything in this game -- that looks the same; against
// something bright it dims a little where the game would have flared.
//
// The file: <card>/_nds/hl_nds/data/spr/<name>.<w>x<h>.htx, a cooked texture
// (HlTexture.hpp) like any other.
