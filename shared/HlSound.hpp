// Sound: the file a cooked sound is in, the sounds every map has, and how
// the game says "this was heard, here".
//
// A cooked sound (.hsn, under snd/ on the card) is IMA-ADPCM exactly as the
// DS's sound hardware plays it: a four-byte header (the first sample and the
// step it starts at) and then four bits a sample. The hardware loops it too,
// from a point given in words (four bytes, eight samples).
//
// The game's shared code does not play anything. Where something happens
// that is heard -- a door starts, a shot is fired, a headcrab lands -- it
// puts a SoundEvent on a queue; the console empties the queue each frame
// into its sixteen channels, and the host tests read it to see that what
// should have been heard was.
//
// std-only: shared with the converter and the tests.
