// The player's movement: walking, falling, jumping, crouching, climbing steps.
//
// This follows the structure and the constants of Half-Life's own player
// movement (pm_shared.c: friction, accelerate, the four-bump slide move, the
// 18-unit step, the split gravity step) so that the game feels like itself --
// the speed, the jump height and the way the player slides along a wall are
// part of what the maps were built around. It is a fixed-point rewrite, not a
// translation: positions and velocities are Q12, time is Q16 seconds, and
// every product goes through 64 bits (HlFixed.hpp).
//
// Brush entities are collided with through HlMovers.hpp: the trace used here
// covers the world and every solid brush.
//
// Being carried and pushed by moving brushes is the entity logic's doing
// (HlLogic.hpp).
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE YET: water, fall damage.
//
// std-only and inline, like HlHullTrace.hpp, so the host tests drive the very
// code the console runs. Sine and cosine are not available here (the DS's
// tables live in libnds), so the caller hands in the view's horizontal axes.
