// What makes a map do things: doors, buttons, triggers and the wiring between
// them.
//
// In the PC game every one of these is an object with virtual Use, Touch and
// Think, driven by an engine that calls them. Here they are rows of a table
// (LogicRecord, HlLevel.hpp) that the converter filled in from the map's
// entity lump, a second table of live state, and one function per event --
// the design of the PS1 port this project follows. It is far less general and
// that is the point: the whole of it fits in the instruction cache's worth of
// code and a few kilobytes of state.
//
// The BEHAVIOUR, though, is the PC game's, rule for rule, because maps are
// built against the details: a door fires its target at BOTH ends of its
// travel; a door that has a name cannot be opened by walking into it; a button
// resets the multisource it feeds when it pops back out. Each rule below is
// from the SDK (dlls/doors.cpp, buttons.cpp, triggers.cpp, subs.cpp).
//
// HOW THINGS TALK. Every entity may have a NAME and a TARGET. Firing a target
// means "use" every entity with that name. Using does a different thing per
// kind (logicUse). A fire can be delayed -- that is the event queue -- and can
// remove entities by name first (killtarget).
//
// TIME is milliseconds, advanced once per displayed frame by however long the
// frame took.
//
// std-only and inline, like the collision it sits on: the host tests run it.
