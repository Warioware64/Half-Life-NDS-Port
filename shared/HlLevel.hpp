// The cooked level: the file the converter writes for each map and the DS
// reads, <card>/_nds/hl_nds/data/maps/<map>.hlm.
//
// THE SHAPE. A fixed header, a directory of sections, then the sections: each
// one a flat array of fixed-size records, 4-byte aligned. The DS reads the
// whole file into one heap block with one fread and points into it -- there is
// no parsing, no per-record allocation and nothing to free but the block.
// (yas is used for the manifest and the saves, where the data is a graph. A
// level is tables, and tables are what this is.)
//
// THE CONTRACT. LevelView::open() (HlLevelReader.hpp) checks every index a
// record holds into another section before anything uses it, the same promise
// the converter's BspFile makes about a .bsp. The renderer and the hull trace
// run in ITCM with no bounds checks; they can because of that one pass.
//
// VERSIONING. A level file says two things of itself, and this build knows
// three of its own (the "min and target" of it):
//
//   file   version     the format it was written in (the target of the
//                      converter that cooked it)
//   file   minReader   the oldest build that can read it: a change a build
//                      from before it cannot make sense of raises this to the
//                      new version; one it can (an unused field filled in) does
//                      not
//   build  kLevelVersion      the newest format this build writes and knows
//   build  kLevelMinVersion   the oldest format this build still reads
//   build  kLevelSaveSince    the oldest format whose SAVES this build still
//                      accepts (HlSave.hpp): what a save holds of a map is
//                      indices into its records, so only a change to those
//                      moves it
//
// Bump kLevelVersion on ANY change to a record or to what a field means.
// Then raise kLevelMinVersion (and kLevelMinReader) only if the old layout is
// no longer read, and kLevelSaveSince only if saves of the old one would no
// longer find what they point at. A file outside what a build reads is
// refused with "convert again": the source of truth is the player's copy of
// the game and re-cooking is cheap.
//
// Coordinates keep Half-Life's axes (X forward, Y left, Z up). The swap to the
// geometry engine's axes lives in the view matrix, not in the data.
//
// Formats named in comments (Q12, Q30, ...) are defined in HlFixed.hpp.
