// A cooked model: mdl/<name>.hmd, made by the converter from one of the game's
// studio models, and its skin, mdl/<name>.htx.
//
// WHAT IS IN IT
//
//   Bones      the skeleton: each bone's parent.
//   Batches    the skin, as ready-made geometry-engine command streams (the
//              same idea as a level's surfaces). A batch is one sub-model of
//              one body part -- a head, a holster -- cut so that it uses at
//              most kModelBatchBones bones, and it lists them: the DS puts
//              each bone's matrix in a slot of the hardware's matrix stack,
//              and the stream says "use slot N" before the vertices that
//              belong to that bone. Every vertex of these models belongs to
//              exactly one bone, which is what makes this possible.
//   Clips      animations: for each bone a track of keys (a rotation and a
//              place relative to its parent), at a step chosen per bone by
//              how fast it moves. A map's models carry only the clips that
//              map uses.
//   Events     moments of a clip that fire a target by name.
//
// UNITS. A vertex is in its bone's space, 16-bit, 1/kModelVertexScale of a
// unit (or coarser for a model too big for that: `vertexShift`). The DS
// builds, for each bone, the matrix that takes such a vertex straight to view
// space, on the CPU and in 64-bit, so nothing is lost on the way.
//
// Like a level, the file is checked in full when it is opened
// (ModelView::open) so that drawing and animating need no bounds checks.
