// Actors: the people and props of a map that are models, as they are right
// now.
//
// An actor is a place, a way it faces, and a clip of its model at some frame.
// Left alone it stands and loops its idle clip (or holds a pose, or cycles).
// A scripted sequence can take it over -- walk it to a mark, turn it, have it
// act something out -- and that half lives in HlLogic.hpp with the rest of
// what a map's wiring does; this file is the actor itself and the parts of it
// that need no wiring.
//
// There is no thinking here. An actor does not see, hear or decide; it goes
// where a script sends it, in a straight line.
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it.
