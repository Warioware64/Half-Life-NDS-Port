// What a host sends the consoles it gave the game to by Download Play
// (HLDS_CHILD): first, in the program's parameter, where to find it; then,
// over the game's own link, the guest streams (HlGuest.hpp) they play from --
// the common one when they come, at a match's start its map's group's base
// (if they have not got it) and the map's own.
//
// One stream at a time goes to all who want it at once: the host's frames
// are heard by every client. Each guest says, in its answer to every frame,
// which pieces it has: the first it lacks, which of the next 64 have come,
// and how far it has room for (it hands them on in order, as its loaders
// read them, and keeps no more than 64). The host sends what any of them
// lacks, lowest first, going round what lies between the lowest first-lacked
// and 64 past it; so a piece lost by one is sent again, and heard again by
// all. A guest that says nothing for a while is left out, and the others go
// on without it.
//
// std-only: the host tests run it, over a radio that loses frames.
