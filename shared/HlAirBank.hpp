// What a console sent the game asks for when it wants it, over the radio
// (a texture as it comes into view, a weapon taken up, a map's picture, who
// another player chose to be) -- where a stream (HlNetAir.hpp) is one thing
// for everyone, from its start to its end.
//
// A bank is a file of the host's: a table, then its members, each packed on
// its own, so that any one can be taken alone. The table says what each
// comes to and a checksum of what it is sent as, which the console tries it
// against: nothing that comes over the air here is taken on trust.
//
//   The console asks by a Fetch event (of the game's: resent until heard).
//   The host sends it round to whoever wants it, a few pieces a frame, after
//   the game's own frames; all hear them, so two who want one thing share it.
//   The console says how far it is, a few times a second, by FetchHave;
//   FetchHave at the end says it has it all.
//
// std-only, and no file: the host tests it with pieces lost and pieces bad.
