// What the buttons and the stylus mean: from what is held this frame to what
// the player is doing.
//
// Two layouts, chosen in the options.
//
// CLASSIC is the way DS first-person shooters have it: the stylus turns the
// view, the D-pad moves, and A B X Y do what the D-pad does, for whichever
// thumb is free. One shoulder button fires, the other is the weapon's second
// use. Everything else is on the touch screen (HlTouchLayout.hpp).
//
// MODERN keeps the D-pad and the shoulders and gives the four face buttons
// work of their own: the top one the next weapon, the left one a reload, the
// bottom one a crouch (held, as the game's), the right one a jump. With the
// second shoulder button held, down on the pad crouches -- and stays
// crouched -- and up stands. One short tap of the stylus on the aim pad is
// USE.
//
// CUSTOM is the player's own: any action on any button (Start is always the
// menu, so nobody can lose the way out). Each layout is a table of which
// buttons each action is (defaultKeys); a custom one starts as a copy of the
// layout it was made from.
//
// Either way, two quick taps on the aim pad jump (and holding the second
// keeps the jump held, for swimming up); a touch that starts on a control is
// that control and never turns the view, however far it then slides.
//
// THE HAND. "Pad" above is the D-pad for someone with the stylus in their
// right hand; with it in the left, the pad is A B X Y -- by where they are:
// X up, B down, Y left, A right -- the D-pad has the face buttons' work, and
// the shoulders change places: the hand that holds the console is the one
// that moves and fires.
//
// THE STICKS. The pad and the stylus are two sticks, and which does what can
// be changed an axis at a time: the pad's left and right can turn the view
// while the stylus's sideways travel sidesteps, and its up and down can look
// while the stylus's moves. A stylus that moves is a stick: how far it is
// from where it came down, past a dead zone, is the direction.
//
// THE STYLUS, FINELY. Where the console can say so, a touch is read finer than
// a pixel (its raw reading, by the firmware's calibration: sixteenths of a
// pixel) and with how hard it is pressed. A light touch -- the stylus landing
// or leaving, a palm brushing -- reads wrong, so a touch lighter than the
// firmest of its stroke by more than the "firmness" setting allows is left
// out (which is what takes away the jump as it lifts); and two readings are
// averaged, the firmer counting for more. Pressed hard on the aim pad, it can be an action of its
// own (the "firm press"). Where the console cannot say how hard (a DSi in its
// own touch mode; an emulator), none of this is done: pixels, as before.
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it (test_controls).
