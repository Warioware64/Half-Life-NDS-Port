// A weapon chosen as the game's numbered menu chooses one, with the stylus:
// a slot touched slides up the list of that slot's weapons (those carried,
// in the game's order) above it, over the aim pad; a weapon in it touched --
// or the slot pressed and the stylus slid up onto one and lifted -- is taken.
// A touch anywhere else, the same slot again, or three seconds of nothing,
// puts it away. A slot with only one weapon in it takes that one at once.
//
// What a touch of the list is, is decided here, before the controls are
// asked (HlControls.hpp): a touch that is the list's is not theirs. Drawn by
// render/BottomScreen; std-only, for the host tests.
